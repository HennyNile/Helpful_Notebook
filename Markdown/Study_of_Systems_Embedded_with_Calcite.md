# Study of Systems Embedded with Apache Calcite

In this document, l will introduce several systems that embed with [Apache Calcite](https://github.com/apache/calcite) from following aspects: motivation, optimizer, execution engine and storage.  According to calcite paper, We could have an overview of such systems.

![List of systems that embed Calcite](./pictures/list_of_systems_that_embed_Calcite.png)

This study is to find a system where better cardinality estimation could lead to better performance. To implement this, I think **this system should satisfy the following conditions**: (1) **OLAP**, we need a system which is compute-bound; (2) **Use calcite as CBO**; (3) **(optional) In-memory**.

## I. [Apache Drill](https://github.com/apache/drill) (2019, Distributed)

### 1. Motivation

Drill is designed from the ground up to support **high-performance analysis on the semi-structured(such as JSON, Parquet, txt and HBase tables)** and rapidly evolving data coming from modern Big Data applications, while still providing the familiarity and ecosystem of ANSI SQL, the industry-standard query language. Drill provides plug-and-play integration with existing Apache Hive and Apache HBase deployments.

It was inspired in part by [Google's Dremel](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html). Initial release date is in 2019/01/01.

### 2. Optimizer

According to a glimpse of Drill's source code, **drill maybe only use rules of calcite (RBO) to optimize query execution plans**.

### 3. Execution Engine

According to apache calcite paper, drill uses its native execution engine (**maybe Map Reduce which is used in Dremel**).

### 4. Storage

Hadoop data storage system.

## II. [Apache Hive](https://github.com/apache/hive) (2010, Distributed)

### 1. Motivation

The Apache Hive â„¢ data warehouse software **facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL**. Structure can be projected onto data already in storage. A command line tool and JDBC driver are provided to connect users to Hive.

Initial release date is in 2010/10/1.

### 2. Optimizer

**Hive use Calcite's rules and cost model to optimizer query execution plan (RBO+CBO)**.

### 3. Execution Engine

Tez or Spark.

### 4. Storage

Hadoop data storage system.

## III. [Apache Solr](https://github.com/apache/solr) (2004, Standalone)

### 1. Motivation

Solr is a search server built on top of Apache Lucene, an open source, Java-based, information retrieval library. It is designed to drive powerful document retrieval applications - wherever you need to serve data to users based on their queries, Solr can work for you. 

Solr offers support for the simplest keyword searching through to complex queries on multiple fields and faceted search results. [Searching](https://solr.apache.org/guide/7_2/searching.html#searching) has more information about searching and queries.

Initial release date: 2004

### 2. Optimizer

Use Apache Calcite Avatica (a subproject of Apache Calcite), maybe RBO.

### 3. Execution Engine

According to calcite paper, Solr uses native execution engine, Enumerable or Apache Lucene.

### 4. Storage

Maybe use storage component of Apache Lucene.

## IV. [Apache Phoenix](https://github.com/apache/phoenix) (2014, Distributed)

### 1. Motivation

Become **the trusted data platform for OLTP and operational analytics for Hadoop** through well-defined, industry standard APIs.

Apache Phoenix enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications by combining the best of both worlds:

- the power of standard SQL and JDBC APIs with full ACID transaction capabilities and
- the flexibility of late-bound, schema-on-read capabilities from the NoSQL world by leveraging HBase as its backing store

Apache Phoenix is fully integrated with other Hadoop products such as Spark, Hive, Pig, Flume, and Map Reduce.

### 2. Optimizer

Use calcite as RBO

### 3. Execution Engine

Apache HBase

### 4. Storage

Hadoop.

### 3. Execution Engine

Spark

### 4. Storage

Hadoop(offline), HBase(online)

## VI. [Apache Apex](https://github.com/apache/apex-core) (closed in 2018, Distributed)

### 1. Motivation

Apache Apex is a unified platform for big data stream and batch processing. Use cases include ingestion, ETL, real-time analytics, alerts and real-time actions. Apex is a Hadoop-native YARN implementation and uses HDFS by default. It simplifies development and productization of Hadoop applications by reducing time to market. Key features include Enterprise Grade Operability with Fault Tolerance, State Management, Event Processing Guarantees, No Data Loss, In-memory Performance & Scalability and Native Window Support. (like hive).
